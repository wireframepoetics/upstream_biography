we went camping and one night i awoke in our tent, my mother talking rapidly 
to my dad. the wind was howling louder that I have ever experienced before.
it was raining so hard that we water was running down the small hill into
our tent. my mother was trying to dig small trenches into the sandy soil.
but i was not concerned by the fact that all my stuff might get wet. I
lay there, listening to the storm. being inside that storm.
