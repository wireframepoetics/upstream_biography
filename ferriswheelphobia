in the background: a ferriswheel. turning. blinking lights and other revelations.

  and he told me that is was over and my head hurt. the wound where they ripped out my
  wisdom tooth got infected and the pain drove me almost mad. I hadn't eaten in 4 days.
  we spent the afternoon with our friends by the river and you smoked and drank wine
  and I sat there. quietly. tasting the clover-like taste of some ointment my dentist 
  poured into the hole in my mouth.
  
    he: none of my friends have relationships like ours. it doesn't feel right.
    i am tired of waiting for you to feel better.
    
    me: ()
        i knew he wasn't talking about my no-existing tooth
    
    he: i am sure it is best if both of us can start fresh in the new city.
    
  we were supposed to move together to a city be both fell in love with. 
  and i hated him for leaving me bare again. and with an aching tooth that was not
  even there anymore.

in the background: a ferriswheel. turning. blinking lights and other revelations.
ever since that night i am afraid of ferrisweels.
