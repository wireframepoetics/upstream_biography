unicycle friend. we rode our unicycles through empty streets in the late summer.
we could not go back into your house because your mother was practicing her qi-gon.
and we were not allow to disrupt her routine. we ran through your garden. someone
had installed a swing, made from an old rope and a tire on the property next to your 
garden. we sliped trough a hole in the fence. of course we did. we were reckless,
pirate queens and botanical witches and hogwarts students and side-by-side computer 
gamers.
